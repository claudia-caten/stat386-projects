This post will walk you through my beginnings in Data Science and learning how to blog simply.


# Beginnings
I decided officially to switch my emphasis to Data Science this past summer and now I am graduating this April. I have a lot to learn and I am excited to get there. 

## Blogging
I have recently learned about the importance of blogging. Although this is a very foriegn and I'll admit uncomfortable topic for me, here I am writing my first blog post!

I don't expect much to come of these blog posts, if anything I am just hoping to get more practice and experience. The more practice and experience that I get in blogging the more confident I will be in my abilities!

Here is a link to a blog post that inspired me to get more into blogging! This blog really resonated with me, especially as it was written by a female data scientist.

## Why Data Science?
A better question would be why not Data Science? I have always loved numbers, even from a young age. It took a few steps to get here but I have recently found myself in the Data Science emphasis because I have found a passion for coding. I am excited for all of the things that I will learn and all the opportunity that will come with a greater knowledge in Data Science. I think in this whole process I am going to learn that **confidence is key**. I know that I will be able to accomplish much more if I believe in myself and as I try to get over the feelings of imposter syndrome.
